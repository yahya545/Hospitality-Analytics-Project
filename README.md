# Hospitality-Analytics-Project
This project analyzes hospitality industry data using Power BI, covering the complete data lifecycle from data import and transformation to data modeling, analysis, and visualization. The analysis provides insights that can assist hospitality businesses in improving decision-making by understanding key metrics such as occupancy rates, revenue, customer satisfaction, and more.

# Key Features
1. Data Import and Transformation**: 
   - Cleaned and transformed raw data in Power Query Editor for structured analysis.
   
2. Data Modeling**: 
   - Built a comprehensive data model with 6 one-to-many relationships to ensure accurate aggregation and filtering in the dashboard.

3. DAX Calculations**: 
   - Created custom DAX measures and calculated columns to derive insights such as total revenue, average occupancy rate, and customer satisfaction scores.

4. Interactive Dashboard**: 
   - Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with key performance indicators (KPIs), charts, and tables to provide actionable insights.

# Project Insights
- Occupancy Trends**: Analysis of hotel occupancy rates over time to identify high and low-demand seasons.
- Revenue Metrics**: Insights into total revenue and revenue per available room (RevPAR).
- Customer Feedback**: Trends and patterns in customer satisfaction based on review scores.
- City-Wise Analysis**: The dashboard allows users to filter data by city to compare performance metrics across different locations.
- Room Class Analysis: Performance comparison across different room classes (Premium, Elite, Standard), enabling a deeper understanding of revenue and occupancy trends based on room categories.
  
# Tools & Technologies
- Power BI**: For data transformation, modeling, and visualization.
